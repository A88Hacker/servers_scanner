CVE Name: CVE-2019-6110 
Description of vulnerability: In OpenSSH 7.9, due to accepting and displaying arbitrary stderr output from the server, a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can manipulate the client output, for example to use ANSI control codes to hide additional files being transferred.

CVE Name: CVE-2019-6109 
Description of vulnerability: An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to missing character encoding in the progress display, a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can employ crafted object names to manipulate the client output, e.g., by using ANSI control codes to hide additional files being transferred. This affects refresh_progress_meter() in progressmeter.c.

CVE Name: CVE-2020-14145 
Description of vulnerability: The client side in OpenSSH 5.7 through 8.4 has an Observable Discrepancy leading to an information leak in the algorithm negotiation. This allows man-in-the-middle attackers to target initial connection attempts (where no host key for the server has been cached by the client). NOTE: some reports state that 8.5 and 8.6 are also affected.

CVE Name: CVE-2019-6111 
Description of vulnerability: An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp, the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the scp client target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).

CVE Name: MSF:AUXILIARY-SCANNER-SSH-SSH_ENUMUSERS- 
Description of vulnerability: This module uses a malformed packet or timing attack to enumerate users on an OpenSSH server. The default action sends a malformed (corrupted) SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST packet using public key authentication (must be enabled) to enumerate users. On some versions of OpenSSH under some configurations, OpenSSH will return a "permission denied" error for an invalid user faster than for a valid user, creating an opportunity for a timing attack to enumerate users. Testing note: invalid users were logged, while valid users were not. YMMV.

Description of vulnerability: OpenSSH 7.7 through 7.9 and 8.x before 8.1, when compiled with an experimental key type, has a pre-authentication integer overflow if a client or server is configured to use a crafted XMSS key. This leads to memory corruption and local code execution because of an error in the XMSS key parsing algorithm. NOTE: the XMSS implementation is considered experimental in all released OpenSSH versions, and there is no supported way to enable it when building portable OpenSSH.
